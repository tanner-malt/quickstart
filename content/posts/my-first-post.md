## Introduction

Put simply, this is my website where I will do some blogging, I'll be going over things I find interesting, learned, want to learn, or anything else that catches my attention.

Now that you know what this is, who am I?

My name is Tanner, I'm 26 years old, and I graduated from the University of Akron in 2022. I currently work as a Cost Analyst, where I estimate the cost to make wire harnesses, and outside of work I'm a 
gamer and outdoors person. Learning to snowboard (not going well), and wanting to get more into rock climbing and hiking!
